    <p class="mb-6 text-lg leading-relaxed border-l-4 border-yellow-500 pl-4">
      <strong>Vozmia</strong> is an AI-ready business directory designed to help users connect directly with local businesses through smart, conversational interfaces.
      Our mission is to empower businesses to teach the AI what they truly are—by simply answering questions.
    </p>

        <p>
          Our AI doesn't assume—it asks. Like a child learning its first words, Vozmia's chatbot starts with questions and learns from the source: the business owners themselves. This approach minimizes hallucinations and ensures answers are accurate, trustworthy, and human-approved.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Training With Every Interaction</h3>
        <p>
          When a customer asks a question—like "Do you offer gluten-free options?"—and the owner replies "Yes, every item is customizable!", Vozmia learns that response. From then on, the AI can answer that question instantly and reliably.

        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">A Smarter Local Experience</h3>
        <p>
          Vozmia bridges the gap between automation and authenticity. We believe that the best AI is one that listens first—then speaks from real knowledge. Each business trains its own assistant, and customers benefit from faster, clearer support.
